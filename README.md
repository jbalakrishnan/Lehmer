SageMath and PARI/GP code for 

 * [BCO] ``Variations of Lehmer's Conjecture for Ramanujan's tau-function'' (Jennifer S. Balakrishnan, William Craig, and Ken Ono)
and
 * [BCOT] ``Variants of Lehmer's Speculation for newforms'' (Jennifer S. Balakrishnan, William Craig, Ken Ono, and Wei-Lun Tsai) 

The folder tau has three files:
 * The file chabauty.sage has the code used in Lemma 2.3 of [BCO]. The two curves the code was run on are at the end of the file.
 * The files C6.sage and H6.sage have the code used in Lemma 2.4 of [BCO].
 
The folder newforms has several files:
 * The file F2.gp has the list of pairs (2m, F_{2m}) for m = 1,...,98, used in Section 4 of [BCOT]. 
 * The file thue_unconditional.gp has the code used in Lemma 4.1 of [BCOT].
 * The file thue_conditional.gp has the code used in Lemma 4.1 of [BCOT].
 * More to come!
